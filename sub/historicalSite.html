                <p>This is Pasig’s oldest surviving bahay na bato. Don Cecilio Tech y Cabrera built it in the early 1850s. It has housed seven generations of the Tech family and has witnessed key historical events in Pasig and around the country. Don Cecilio’s direct descendants are still living there.</p>
                <p>During Martial Law, it was known as Freedom House because it could be used by all sides of the political spectrum for meetings. It was also the unofficial San Jose Barangay Headquarters for a while. There were also art exhibits presented here. The Santo Nino de Pasion, on the other hand, is likewise housed in the Bahay na Tisa. Moreover, every Sunday following Easter, the sick people of the community came inside the home to receive Holy Communion and the Parish Priest’s benediction (Viatico Publico).</p>

                <p>Plaza Rizal is an open space park located just across from the Pasig City Museum. The Plaza location was originally the site of the first beaterio outside of Manila, known as the Beaterio de Sta. Rita de Pasig, who was born in 1740. After the beaterio was heavily damaged during WWII, it made way for the creation of a park in honor of the country’s national hero, Dr. Jose Rizal.</p>
                <p>Plaza Bonifacio is dedicated to the country’s lone sculpture of Andres Bonifacio riding a horse, a suitable tribute from the local government to Bonifacio for his leadership in the armed struggle for Philippine independence. Behind the sculpture lies the “Nagsabado sa Pasig” Memorial, which was built to commemorate the events of August 1896, when Filipinos assembled to plan an attack against the Spaniards.</p>
